Welcome to the central knowledge base for the Gen Z Jewelry project. This directory is organized to help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently.

## Directory Structure

- **`/architecture`**: Contains high-level design documents, decisions, and notes on the core systems. If you want to understand *how* our system is built, start here.

    - **`/features/filters`**: All documents related to the product filtering system.
    - **`/features/widgets`**: All documents related to the concierge widget.

- **`/guides`**: Practical "how-to" guides, playbooks, and tutorials for developers. This includes setup instructions and guides for common tasks.

- **`/planning`**: Documents related to project planning, roadmaps, and future work.

- **`/runbooks`**: Step-by-step guides for operational tasks, incident response, and system maintenance.

- **`/archive`**: A repository of historical documents, such as completed audit reports, post-mortems, and logs of completed tasks. This is for historical context, not current state.

- **`/api`**: API contracts and documentation.

- **`/analytics`**: Documentation related to analytics, tracking, and events.
