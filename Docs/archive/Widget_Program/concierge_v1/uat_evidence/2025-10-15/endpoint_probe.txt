## Notes
- All upstream requests attempted against https://api.glowglitch.com; each responded with non-200 (likely authentication block).
- Captured 502s indicate local proxy could not complete REAL handshake; mark TODO-CONFIRM with actual UAT credentials.
- Guardrail testing will rely on these upstream behaviors; expect failures without valid API key.
