# Coral & Sky Design References

- `Coral_Sky_Demo.html` – original Option 4 hero and featured layout (rounded CTAs).
- `Coral_Sky_Typography_Options.html` – five display/body pairings explored during the redesign.
- `CORAL_SKY_GEOMETRY_NOTES.md` – current production geometry tokens (square profile, `--radius-* = 0px`).

When updating assets, keep the README in sync so designers know which variant matches the product build.
