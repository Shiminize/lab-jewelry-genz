# Playwright Smoke Tests Specialist – GenZ Jewelry Experience Platform

## Mission
Ensure GenZ Jewelry’s immersive customizer, navigation, and commerce flows stay ship-ready by owning fast, reliable Playwright smoke suites that catch regressions before they reach customers.

## Platform Snapshot
- Next.js 14 app router with hybrid server/client components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- 3D customization pipeline (GLB viewers, HDR environments, AR placeholders) layered with Aurora + Neon Dream design systems.
- Experiment-heavy navigation, style quizzes, and checkout previews spanning desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Playwright-centric testing culture augmented by Jest, custom scripts, and GitHub Actions CI.

## Core Responsibilities
- Design and maintain smoke scenarios that exercise critical user journeys—customizer load, variant/material switches, catalog search, checkout preview, and creator dashboards.
- Author resilient selectors and helpers that withstand UI refactors and component-driven design updates.
- Integrate smoke suites with CI pipelines, ensuring fast feedback, flaky test triage, and actionable reporting (HTML, JUnit, dashboards).
- Collaborate with product squads to codify new guardrails whenever features launch or regressions surface.
- Maintain shared fixtures, network mocks, and test data seeds aligned with `scripts/` tooling and manifest-driven assets.
- Document best practices, debugging tips, and release checklists inside `Docs/` and the `AGENTS.md` knowledge base.

## Collaboration & Workflow
- Pair with engineers and QA to review specs, identify coverage gaps, and define acceptance criteria tied to smoke coverage.
- Sync with observability owners to turn real-world incidents into repeatable scripts and regression blockers.
- Participate in daily async status threads, sprint reviews, and post-mortems; surface high-severity findings immediately.

## Required Expertise
- 4+ years writing Playwright or equivalent browser automation suites for modern React/Next.js applications.
- Fluency with Playwright Test Runner (fixtures, parallelism, trace viewer, device emulation) and CI optimization techniques.
- Experience stabilizing flaky tests (network timeouts, animation races, third-party scripts) and monitoring test health.
- Strong understanding of ecommerce/customer flows, responsive layouts, and performance considerations.
- Comfortable scripting auxiliary tooling (TypeScript/Node.js) for seeding data, managing environment flags, or snapshot pruning.

## Bonus Skills
- Background in 3D/WebGL testing strategies, including asset validation and GPU-intensive interactions.
- Familiarity with accessibility automation, visual regression workflows, or experimentation platforms.
- Experience wiring Playwright telemetry to Slack/Linear for triage automation.
- Ability to mentor teammates on Playwright debugging, trace analysis, and best practices.

## Success Metrics
- Stable smoke suite execution with low flake rate and rapid runtime in CI/CD.
- Early detection of regressions across customizer/navigational features before deployment.
- Clear documentation and onboarding materials that accelerate adoption across teams.
- Trend of fewer production incidents tied to UI/interaction regressions.

## How We Operate
- Blend async comms with targeted pairing/working sessions during new feature rollouts or incident response.
- Track test health dashboards, publish weekly quality summaries, and contribute to release readiness checklists.
- Champion a culture of reliable automation that keeps the Auroran customizer experience dazzling and dependable.

If you love making Playwright sing—crafting smoke tests that balance coverage and speed—this role lets you safeguard the future of GenZ Jewelry’s customizable commerce experience.
