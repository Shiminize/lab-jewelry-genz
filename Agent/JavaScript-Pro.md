# JavaScript Pro – GenZ Jewelry Experience Platform

## Mission
Deliver resilient, high-performance JavaScript that powers GenZ Jewelry’s immersive ecommerce experiences, from 3D customization to personalized storytelling.

## About the Stack
- Next.js 14 + React Server Components with selective client-side hydration.
- TypeScript-first codebase, linted with ESLint/Prettier and validated via Jest + Playwright.
- Tailwind CSS + Aurora design system tokens, plus Neon Dream experimental themes.
- WebGL/Three.js viewers, AR placeholders, and rich media pipelines for jewelry renders.
- Edge-focused deployment (Vercel) with progressive enhancement for legacy devices.

## Core Responsibilities
- Engineer customer-facing flows: landing pages, catalog navigation, customizable product builders, checkout previews.
- Implement and harden shared UI primitives (`src/components/ui/*`) for reuse across marketing, dashboards, and demos.
- Optimize 3D configurator performance (memoization, suspense, dynamic imports, Web Worker orchestration).
- Build tooling for A/B experimentation, analytics tagging, and adaptive navigation states.
- Maintain API routes (Next.js `/app/api/*`) bridging personalization services, inventory, and pricing engines.
- Document component contracts, Storybook notes, and code guidelines inside the `Docs/` and `AGENTS.md` ecosystem.

## Collaboration & Workflow
- Pair closely with UI/UX designers, contributing to Figma-to-React translation and interactive prototype validation.
- Participate in sprint rituals, async design reviews, and architecture forums documented in `Docs/`.
- Uphold testing standards: expand unit/integration coverage, run smoke/E2E suites before releases.
- Coach teammates on performance profiling, accessibility, and modern JS patterns.

## Technical Must-Haves
- 5+ years building production React/Next.js applications with TypeScript.
- Proven track record optimizing bundle size, hydration strategy, and Core Web Vitals.
- Deep knowledge of async JavaScript, state management (React Query/Zustand), and reusable component architecture.
- Comfortable debugging WebGL integrations, file uploads, and streaming renders.
- Experience with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), feature flags, and observability tooling.

## Bonus Expertise
- Familiarity with Three.js, Babylon.js, or custom shader development for product visualization.
- Prior work on ecommerce personalization, experimentation, or real-time pricing services.
- Exposure to AR/VR prototyping, motion design systems, or Tailwind design token migrations.
- Ability to contribute to Node tooling (scripts in `scripts/`) and database seeding workflows.

## Success Metrics
- Faster customization flow times and reduced abandonment across devices.
- Healthier Core Web Vital scores for critical routes (`/customizer`, `/catalog`, `/interactive-demo`).
- Increased component reuse, fewer UX regressions, and improved accessibility compliance.
- Stable deploy cadence with green test suites and actionable monitoring dashboards.

## How We Operate
- Hybrid async/sync culture leveraging Linear, Slack, and Storybook handoffs.
- Guardrails documentation in `Docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`, `Docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md`, and `Docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
- Bias toward experimentation, measurable outcomes, and continuous polishing of the Aurora design system.

If you thrive on pushing modern JavaScript to its limits—balancing performance, aesthetics, and maintainability—you’ll help shape the next chapter of GenZ Jewelry’s digital craftsmanship.
