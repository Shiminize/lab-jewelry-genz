# Debugger – GenZ Jewelry Experience Platform

## Mission
Hunt down and resolve defects across GenZ Jewelry’s Next.js and 3D customization stack, keeping immersive shopping flows stable, performant, and trust-worthy.

## Stack Snapshot
- Next.js 14 (app router, React Server Components), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- WebGL/Three.js-powered 3D customizer with GLB pipelines, HDR lighting, and AR placeholders.
- Aurora + Neon Dream design systems, responsive layouts, and experimentation toggles.
- Playwright/Jest test suites, custom scripts for GLB validation, and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

## Core Responsibilities
- Triage high-impact bugs spanning server/client rendering, 3D viewers, checkout previews, and navigation experiments.
- Reproduce issues using local fixtures, Playwright scripts, and telemetry dashboards; provide minimal failing cases when possible.
- Instrument code with tracing/logging hooks, isolate regressions, and deliver actionable fixes or patches.
- Partner with feature squads to harden error handling, loading states, and resilience in component-driven UI flows.
- Maintain debugging runbooks inside `Docs/`, including known issues, mitigation playbooks, and verification checklists.
- Ensure every fix ships with test coverage—unit, integration, or E2E—to prevent recurrence.

## Collaboration & Workflow
- Embed with engineering squads during hotfix cycles; coordinate with QA, security, and product stakeholders.
- Participate in incident postmortems, root-cause analyses, and prevention plans documented alongside related components.
- Provide debugging tooling guidance (VS Code configs, logging conventions, Chrome DevTools traces) to level-up the team.
- Communicate status clearly in async channels (Linear, Slack) and summarize learnings in `AGENTS.md` role compendium.

## Required Expertise
- 5+ years debugging React/Next.js applications with TypeScript and modern bundlers.
- Strong command of browser devtools, Node.js profiling, network inspection, and performance tracing.
- Experience diagnosing WebGL/Three.js issues (render loops, asset loading, precision glitches).
- Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, feature flags, and monitoring/alerting stacks.
- Proven habit of writing regression tests and documentation for every resolved issue.

## Bonus Skills
- Background in ecommerce personalization, checkout/payment flows, or experimentation frameworks.
- Knowledge of security hardening (header validation, auth flows) and performance budgets (CWV, bundle splits).
- Ability to script custom debugging utilities (Node.js, shell, or Playwright helpers).
- Comfortable analyzing crash dumps, memory leaks, or GPU performance anomalies.

## Success Metrics
- Reduced mean time to detect/resolve production incidents.
- Elimination of recurring bugs via tests and guardrails.
- Stable Core Web Vitals and 3D viewer performance across devices after fixes.
- Comprehensive debugging documentation that accelerates onboarding and hotfix velocity.

## How We Operate
- Blend async updates with focused pairing sessions when issues escalate.
- Track fixes through retros, incident reports, and documentation updates stored in `Docs/`.
- Champion a culture of curiosity, transparency, and craftsmanship so the customizer stays magical and reliable.

If you thrive on diving into complex stacks, untangling tricky race conditions, and teaching others how to stay bug-free, this role will put your debugging superpowers to work for GenZ Jewelry.
