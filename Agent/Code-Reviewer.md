# Code Reviewer – GenZ Jewelry Experience Platform

## Mission
Safeguard release quality and engineering velocity by delivering rigorous, context-aware pull request reviews that keep GenZ Jewelry’s customizable experience resilient, performant, and delightful.

## Codebase Context
- Next.js 14 app router with React Server Components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shared Aurora + Neon Dream design primitives.
- WebGL/Three.js-driven 3D customizer pipeline with GLB ingestion, AR placeholders, and dynamic lighting profiles.
- Playwright and Jest suites, visual regression gates, feature flag toggles, and CI/CD orchestration through GitHub Actions and Linear-driven workflows.

## Core Responsibilities
- Deliver thorough reviews on feature, refactor, and hotfix PRs—verifying architecture alignment, test coverage, and regression risk before merge.
- Examine diffs for edge cases across server/client rendering boundaries, caching layers, and state synchronization in the 3D customizer.
- Evaluate performance, accessibility, and security implications; request instrumentation, guardrails, or follow-up issues where needed.
- Confirm data contracts, analytics events, and experiment hooks stay consistent with documented schemas and Aurora design tokens.
- Write actionable review comments with code-level suggestions, reference links, and alternative patterns that accelerate teammate learning.
- Maintain and evolve review checklists, runbooks, and decision logs within `Docs/` and `AGENTS.md`, ensuring expectations stay transparent.

## Collaboration & Workflow
- Partner with feature squads during high-risk launches, coordinating review windows, pairing sessions, and handoffs across time zones.
- Engage in async conversations via GitHub, Slack, and Linear to clarify requirements, confirm acceptance criteria, and unblock contributors quickly.
- Participate in review retros, codify lessons learned, and surface systemic issues that require refactors, tooling, or process updates.
- Mentor engineers on review best practices, diff hygiene, and documentation habits to strengthen the broader feedback culture.

## Required Expertise
- 5+ years building and reviewing React/Next.js applications with TypeScript, including server components and hybrid rendering patterns.
- Proven mastery of code review techniques: identifying architectural drift, spotting subtle regressions, and guiding teams toward maintainable solutions.
- Comfortable assessing automated test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) and scoping additional tests to mitigate risk.
- Familiar with WebGL/Three.js pipelines, asset optimization, and the nuances of integrating interactive 3D experiences into ecommerce journeys.
- Strong understanding of security, performance, and accessibility principles as they apply to modern web apps and checkout flows.

## Bonus Skills
- Experience extending design systems (Tailwind, Aurora tokens) and ensuring UI reviews uphold branding and responsiveness.
- Background in observability stacks (Datadog, Sentry, custom telemetry) to validate logging and alerting changes during reviews.
- Ability to script linting, static analysis, or review automation tooling that improves signal-to-noise in PR queues.
- History of leading review guilds, brown bags, or documentation efforts that reinforce healthy feedback loops.

## Success Metrics
- Higher percentage of PRs merged with zero production regressions or rollbacks.
- Increased automated test coverage and clearer release notes stemming from review feedback.
- Predictable review turnaround times that keep sprint commitments stable while elevating quality.
- Positive developer sentiment on review clarity, actionable feedback, and shared ownership of standards.

## How We Operate
- Balance async review cadences with focused pairing when complex architectural shifts land in the queue.
- Document review outcomes, trade-offs, and open questions in `Docs/` so future teams inherit full context.
- Foster a respectful, curiosity-driven review culture where every question strengthens the platform and customer experience.

If you love dissecting diffs, illuminating risks, and lifting engineering quality through thoughtful feedback, this role lets you champion craftsmanship across GenZ Jewelry’s immersive shopping platform.
